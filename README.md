# Website Traffic Analysis

Objective of this project is to analyze, visualize, and forecast website traffic patterns to derive actionable insights, monitor user behavior, and support data-driven decision making.

**Tools Used:** Python (pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset Attribution:**
Dataset sourced from Kaggle: [Website Traffic](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonytherrien/website-traffic)  
CSV files located in `data/raw/` and cleaned data in `data/cleaned/`.

**Key Features and Analysis Steps:**
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, session aggregation, and timestamp normalization.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Compute metrics for page views, unique users, session duration, and bounce rate.
3. **Visualization:** Generate time series plots, heatmaps, and flow diagrams to explore traffic trends.
4. **Predictive Modeling:** Develop and evaluate forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for future traffic predictions.
5. **Reporting:** Export interactive dashboards and summary reports.
